I'm some stupid 15 y/o who doesn't know what to do next so does whatever can and wants. A noob coder interested in Drawing and Art but codes in useless free time. 
A fan (hardcore fan) of Japan, Anime, BTS (KPOP in general) and Manga (and much more), I try to bring to you the most useless and stupid version of softwares already made
and available on the internet. My interests are kinda reflected in the software ( if you could call it ) I make(just saying, incase you were curious).

I actually like C++ (ik I'm weird) but I do ocassionally code in Java cuz that's how school tortures me.

Abilities: Crying.

### Tools I use and prefer:
  1. C/C++/C# ---> Visual Studio, VS Code, Sublime Text and actually anything but notepad.
  2. Java    --->  Fu**ing Anything with heavy intellisense and code completion (haven't found one till now)
  3. OS: Win10 / WSL(Ubuntu)
